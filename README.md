# Haptic_Experiment
Haptic Experiment whereby Stimuli are presented onto the screen for the user to see and a discriminative task defined
such that the USER has to locate the desired character(target) among others 
and use the Haptic Device(in this case Phantom 1.5) to reach the target. 
Several Frames presented for infinitesimal time periods in an attempt to test how fast does the brain distinguish the target 
among others even before the user attempted a movement
