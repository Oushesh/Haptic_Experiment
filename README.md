# Haptic_Experiment

The Goal of this experiment was to build a setup to determine the delay between visual attention and finger movement.
In this Haptic Experiment Stimuli(identical characters) were presented onto the screen. 
Haptic Experiment whereby Stimuli are presented onto the screen for the user to see and a discriminative task defined
such that the USER has to locate the desired character(target) among others and use the Haptic Device(in this case Phantom 1.5) to reach the target. 
Several Frames presented for infinitesimal time periods in an attempt to test how fast does the brain can distinguish the target among others even before the user attempted a movement. This delay is actually timed from the moment the new picture frame appears to the time user uses the device's arm and successfully points to the character on the screen.
